    "Cashier App Client (local application for cashiers)",
    "Manager Web/Desktop Interface (for managers, potentially remote)",

  "dataFlow": [
    "User (Cashier/Manager) interacts with Cashier App Client / Manager Interface (input login, sales items, inventory updates, report requests).",
    "Cashier App Client / Manager Interface sends requests (authentication, sales, inventory, reports) to Application Server.",
    "Application Server processes requests, performs authentication/authorization.",
    "Application Server communicates with MySQL Database to read/write data (user validation, product info, inventory, sales records).",
    "MySQL Database returns query results to Application Server.",
    "Application Server sends processed data/responses (transaction confirmation, updated inventory, reports, authentication status) back to Cashier App Client / Manager Interface.",
    "For remote manager access, encrypted data flows over the Internet between Manager Interface and Application Server.",
    "Sensitive data (e.g., transaction details) is encrypted in transit (between Application Server and Database) and at rest (in Database)."

  "interfaces": [
    "User Interface (for Cashiers and Managers to interact with the system)",
    "Database Interface (SQL for communication between Application Server and MySQL Database)",
    "Network Interface (TCP/IP for communication over LAN and Internet)"

  "trustBoundaries": [
    "User / Application Boundary: All user input is untrusted; requires strong authentication (username/password) and role-based authorization.",
    "Application / Database Boundary: Communication between Application Server and MySQL Database is secured using SSL/TLS. Sensitive data is encrypted in transit and at rest.",
    "Internal Network / External Network Boundary: The Internet (for remote manager access) is an untrusted network. All communication over the Internet is secured via SSL/TLS.",
    "Data Trust Boundary: Sensitive data (e.g., transaction data) is encrypted both in transit and at rest to protect against unauthorized access."
